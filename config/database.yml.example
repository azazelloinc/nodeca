# Database
#

# we wil have redis and mongo connections, but the keys will be different.
# right now it's just a stub, key names would be someting like
# "documents_backend" (by the nature of DB usage)

database:
  redis:
    host: localhost
    port: 6379
    #index: 1

  # Examples:
  #
  # "mongodb://user:password@host:port/database"
  # "user:password@host:port/database"
  # "host/database"
  #
  # For replica set join all addresses into one string, separated by comma.
  #
  mongo: localhost/nodeca-dev
